Action : jump, Object : skis image_name : skis_002829.jpg
When skiing, the part of the skis most commonly used for the action of **jumping** is the **tip** — specifically, the **front end (tip)** of the skis.

Here’s why:

- **Jumping Technique**: Skiers typically initiate a jump by **bending their knees and pushing off with their skis**, using the **tips** to launch into the air. The tips are designed to be **flexible and responsive**, allowing them to absorb impact and provide lift during takeoff.
  
- **Design Features**: The **tips** of modern skis (like the Traverse skis shown) are

Action : jump, Object : skateboard image_name : skateboard_002387.jpg
The part of the skateboard used for the action of "jump" — such as in tricks like ollies, kickflips, or manuals — is primarily the **deck**, specifically the **tail** and **nose**.

Here’s a breakdown:

- **Tail**: The back end of the deck. Skaters use the tail to **pop** (snap it down) to launch the board into the air — this is essential for an **ollie** or other aerial tricks.
- **Nose**: The front end of the deck. Used for tricks like **nose grabs** or **manuals** (balancing

Action : jump, Object : surfboard image_name : surfboard_000658.jpg
Surfboards are not typically used for "jumping" in the way that skateboards or trampolines are — but if you're referring to **"jumping"** as part of a surfing maneuver (like a **cutback**, **snap**, or **air maneuver**), then the **middle to rear section** of the board is most involved.

However, if you're asking which part of the surfboard is used for **initiating or executing a jump** (especially in the context of **foam surfboards** or **beginner boards**, like the Paragon Retro shown), then the answer depends on the

Action : jump, Object : snowboard image_name : snowboard_001704.jpg
When snowboarders perform a **jump**, they primarily use the **entire board**, but the **key functional parts** involved are:

### 1. **The Board’s Edge (Sidecut)**
- The **edges** (especially the **sidecut** — the curved shape of the board’s edge) help with **initiating and landing** jumps.
- When jumping, riders use the **edges** to **carve into the snow** before the jump (to gain speed and control) and to **land cleanly**.

### 2. **The Nose and Tail**
- The **nose** (front)

Action : peel, Object : carrot image_name : carrot_003707.jpg
People typically use the **outer skin (or peel)** of the carrot for the action of **peeling**.

When you "peel" a carrot, you remove its **outer layer** — the thin, tough skin — to reveal the smoother, edible flesh underneath. This is usually done with a **peeler** or a **knife**, as shown in the image with the green-handled knife on the cutting board.

So, the part of the carrot used for the action "peel" is the **outer skin or peel itself** — not the inner flesh, but the layer you remove during peeling.

Action : peel, Object : orange image_name : orange_001193.jpg
People use the **outer skin (rind)** of the orange for the action of "peeling."  

When you peel an orange, you remove this thick, textured outer layer — the **zest** and **pith** — to access the juicy segments inside. The peel is typically discarded, though sometimes it's used in cooking or baking for flavor.

So, the part used for the action "peel" is:  
👉 **The rind or outer skin of the orange.**

Action : peel, Object : banana image_name : banana_000480.jpg
The part of the banana used for the action "peel" is the **outer skin or peel** — specifically, the **yellow outer layer** that surrounds the edible fruit inside.

When someone "peels" a banana, they are removing this outer layer, starting typically from the top (near the stem) and pulling it back to expose the white, edible flesh inside. In the image, you can see the peel has been partially removed — the yellow outer layer is being pulled away from the fruit, which is the exact action of peeling.

So, to answer directly:  
👉 **The yellow outer skin (the peel)

Action : peel, Object : apple image_name : apple_001541.jpg
People use the **outer skin (or peel)** of the apple for the action "peel."

When you "peel" an apple, you remove this thin, outer layer — which is typically red, green, or yellow depending on the variety — to expose the white flesh underneath. The peel is edible but is often removed before eating, especially in cooked dishes or when preparing apples for baking, salads, or smoothies.

In the image, the apple’s peel is clearly visible — shiny and red — and is still intact. The action of peeling would involve using a peeler or knife to remove this layer from the apple’s

Action : wash, Object : cup image_name : cup_003621.jpg
The part of the cup people use for the action "wash" is the **interior surface** — specifically, the **inside of the cup**, including the **bottom and sides** — as well as the **rim** and **handle**, since all these parts come into contact with liquids and hands.

However, if we interpret "action 'wash'" as referring to **washing the cup** (i.e., cleaning it), then:

- **Primary area to wash**: The **inside** of the cup — where liquid and residue accumulate.
- **Secondary areas**: The **outside surface**, including the **handle**, and the **rim

Action : wash, Object : orange image_name : orange_001193.jpg
The question seems to be a playful or confusing mix of words — "which part of orange do people use for action 'wash'?" — which doesn't make literal sense, as oranges are not typically used for washing.

However, if we interpret this as a riddle or pun, perhaps the intended joke is:

> **"The peel!"** — because you *peel* an orange, and "peel" sounds like "wash" in some playful or misheard context? But that’s a stretch.

Alternatively, if we consider the phrase **"wash"** as a misdirection or typo for **"eat"**,

Action : wash, Object : fork image_name : fork_001691.jpg
Actually, **no part of a fork is used for the action "wash"**.

Forks are utensils designed for **eating**, not washing. The tines (the prongs) are used to pierce, lift, and hold food, while the handle is for gripping. The fork does not have any functional part for washing — that’s typically done with water, soap, and perhaps a sponge or brush.

If you’re asking metaphorically or in a riddle-like context, it might be a trick question. But literally — **a fork is not used for washing**.

✅ So, the correct answer is: **

Action : wash, Object : wine_glass image_name : wine_glass_000186.jpg
The part of the wine glass that people typically use for the action "wash" — meaning to rinse or clean the glass — is the **interior surface of the bowl**.

When washing a wine glass, especially by hand, the main focus is on cleaning the **inside of the bowl** where the wine is poured and consumed. This includes:

- The **inner curved surface** (to remove residue or stains),
- The **rim** (to ensure no buildup or bacteria),
- And sometimes the **stem and base**, though these are less critical for hygiene since they don’t come into contact with the drink.

However, if the

Action : wash, Object : bowl image_name : bowl_002825.jpg
People typically use the **interior (inside) surface** of the bowl for the action of "wash."

This is because:

- The **inside** of the bowl is where water, soap, or cleaning agents are placed.
- It’s the **functional area** where items (like hands, dishes, or food) are washed or rinsed.
- The **exterior** (the part with the teal pattern) is decorative and not involved in the washing action.

So, the **inner surface** — the curved, white, smooth part visible in the photo — is the part used for washing.

Action : wash, Object : knife image_name : knife_002720.jpg
The question asks which part of the knife is used for the action "wash," but **knives are not typically used for washing**. Washing usually involves water, soap, and scrubbing—actions performed with hands, sponges, or brushes, not knives.

However, if we interpret the question metaphorically or in the context of **knife maintenance**, then the part used for "washing" (i.e., cleaning) would be the **entire blade and handle**, as both need to be cleaned after use. But if we’re thinking of **washing** in the sense of **sharpening** (as in "

However, in the context of the image you’ve described, the surfboard is lying on the sand with a **black leash attached** near the tail. The leash connects the surfer’s ankle to the board, so it’s not used for “holding” in the sense of gripping with hands, but rather for **keeping the board attached** to the surfer during a fall.

Action : hold, Object : bowl image_name : bowl_000546.jpg
People typically use the **outer rim or sides** of the bowl to hold it.

More specifically, the **curved outer edge (rim)** and the **sides (walls)** of the bowl are grasped with fingers and thumb to lift or carry it. This part provides a stable grip and allows for secure handling without spilling the contents.

In the image, the three bowls shown have wide, rounded rims and sloped sides — ideal for holding with one or two hands. The **rim** is especially important for gripping, especially when the bowl is filled or heavy.
